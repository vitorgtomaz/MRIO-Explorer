# MRIO-Explorer
MRIO-Expllorer is an interactive dashboard where users can upload IO models and explore dependencies, relationships, and propagation of supply chain shocks

## Minimal MRIO calculator page
Open `mrio_calculator.html` in a browser for a lightweight MVP interface where you can:
- enter up to a 10x10 MRIO flow matrix,
- compute row-normalized coefficients,
- compute a truncated Leontief series,
- compute the dominant eigenvalue/eigenvector via power iteration.
